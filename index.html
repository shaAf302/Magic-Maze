        <p>During the game each player has to find his/her revealed treasure card (that can be seen by others).
            The player tries to get to the room showing the same treasure as on this card. For this the player
            needs to

            move the maze, and after that
            move the playing piece.
            Moving the maze is done as follows: the player inserts the extra room into the game board where one
            of the arrows shows the slidable rows and columns, until another room is pushed out of the maze on
            the opposite side. The only exception: The room cannot be inserted back into the board at the same
            place where it was pushed out. So you cannot undo the previous player's move. If the room you push
            out has a playing piece on it, put this piece on the opposite side of the board on the room that was
            just placed. The treasures always move with the rooms.
            <br>

            Once you have moved the maze, you can move your playing piece. You can occupy any square that you
            can move your piece to directly, without interruption. You can move your playing piece as far as you
            like. Or, you can leave your playing piece where it is. There can be more than one playing piece in
            one room: playing pieces do not hit each other. If you are unable to get to the treasure you are
            searching for, you can move your playing piece into a position that gives you a good starting point
            for your next turn. Once you find the treasure you are looking for, reveal your next treasure card.
            On your next turn, find your way to this treasure on the game board.
            <br>
            Now it’s the next player’s turn. This player inserts the extra room into the game board before
            moving their playing piece, and so on.
        </p>
    <h3>            Game Over </h3>

      <p>      The game is over as soon as a player has found all their treasure cards and returned their playing
            piece to its starting position. The first player to do this is the winner.
